138	26	1	Toss green beans, red pepper, white parts of green onions, miso, ginger, 1 Tbsp. olive oil, ½ tsp. salt, and honey on one side of baking sheet. Use your hands to make sure vegetables are evenly coated. Roast 6-8 minutes while you sear salmon.\n
139	26	2	Heat a medium non-stick pan over high heat. Season salmon with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add salmon and 2 tsp. olive oil to very hot pan. Be careful: lay salmon away from you in pan. Cook 2-3 minutes on one side, or until deeply seared. Once vegetables have roasted 6-8 minutes, transfer salmon to other side of baking sheet, seared side up, and brush with tonkatsu sauce. Wipe pan clean.\n
140	26	3	Roast salmon and vegetables 9-11 minutes, or until salmon reaches a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees. Salmon should be firm and opaque and vegetables should be just tender.\n
141	26	4	While salmon and vegetables roast, return pan used to sear salmon to high heat. Add 2 tsp. olive oil and bok choy, cut-side down, to hot pan and cook 2-4 minutes, or until cut-side is charred. Flip and cook 1-2 more minutes, or until bok choy is crisp tender.\n
142	26	5	Arrange miso-ginger vegetables and charred bok choy on plate. Top with salmon and garnish with green parts of green onions and sesame seeds.\n
143	27	0	Thoroughly rinse produce and pat dry. Have lemon. Zest one half. Coarsely chop basil and mint. Coarsely mince garlic cloves. Divide green onions in half, one half cut into a dice, other half slice on a bias (angle) for garnish. Remove membrane and seeds of bell pepper and julienne (cut into thin strips.) \n
144	27	1	In a food processor or blender, combine the peas, garlic, diced green onion (reserving bias-cut for garnish), mint, basil, ¾ of the pine nuts (reserving rest for toasting), 1 Tbsp. olive oil, and juice of the lemon to taste. Blend until smooth. Taste and add salt and pepper and red pepper flakes (reserving a pinch for garnish) to taste. If more tartness is desired, add lemon zest to taste. Allow finished pesto to rest at room temperature for 5 minutes.\n
145	27	2	Bring a medium pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the rigatoni and cook until al dente, about 7-9 minutes. Put a colander in the sink. Drain pasta and return to pot.\n
146	27	3	In a dry small pan over medium heat, add the remaining pine nuts. Move the skillet around for about 1 minute to prevent burning. Pine nuts are done once they have a slightly browned color and a roasted aroma.\n
147	27	4	Add pesto to the drained pasta, fully coating the rigatoni. Add a pinch of salt and fresh black pepper to taste. \n
148	27	5	Add a serving of the pesto rigatoni to a plate or shallow bowl. Garnish with baby arugula, remaining bias-cut green onion, remaining red pepper flakes, toasted pine nuts, red pepper strips, and lemon zest if desired.  Add a crack of fresh black pepper to finish the dish nicely.\n

152	28	3	Combine pineapple, green onion, and roasted red peppers in a small bowl.\n
153	28	4	Once cauliflower is removed from oven, add 1 tsp. lime juice (to taste), ½ tsp. lime zest, and cilantro to cauliflower on baking sheet and stir to combine. Taste, and add another 1 tsp. lime juice if desired.\n
154	28	5	Place charred cauliflower and pineapple-pepper salsa on a plate. Arrange chicken on top.\n
155	29	0	Bring a small pot with parboiled brown rice, 2 cups water, and a pinch of salt to a boil. Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. What's the difference between brown and white rice? Brown rice has only the outer husk removed, leaving the nutritious layer of bran intact (this layer is removed in white rice). It's this layer of bran that gives brown rice a nutty flavor and high fiber. \n
156	29	1	Thoroughly rinse produce and pat dry. Core and cut red and green peppers into 1” dice. Trim and cut green onion into thin slices diagonally. Cut yellow squash into ¾” dice. Lightly crush peanuts with the back of a heavy pan. Rinse shrimp, pat dry, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n

Transfer shrimp to a plate (they'll finish cooking later) and return pan to heat (no need to wipe clean). Caramelizing the shrimp not only makes it look prettier, it also creates a very flavorful crust by browning the natural sugars in the shrimp.\n
158	29	3	Add desired amount of dried chiles (see note below), red pepper, green pepper, and yellow squash to pan and cook for 2 minutes. Add ginger and half the green onions to pan and cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant. Note: Whole dried chiles can be very spicy, especially if they break and the seeds come out. If you're sensitive, you may omit them entirely, or use 1 chile for mild heat, 2 for medium heat, 3 for high heat, and 4 or more for “Hurts so Good!" \n
159	29	4	Add Kung Pao sauce to pan, tossing to coat vegetables thoroughly. Return shrimp to pan and cook until shrimp are cooked throughout and have reached a minimum internal temperature of 130 degrees. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\n
160	29	5	Place a serving of brown rice on a plate and arrange the Kung Pao shrimp and vegetables on top. Garnish with honey-roasted peanuts and remaining green onion. Kung Pao is a classic spicy Szechuan dish named after a Sichuan province Governor whose title was Gungbao (Kung Pao), which loosely translates into "Palace Guardian."\n
161	30	0	Peel and cut potatoes into large chunks. \nBring a medium pot with potato chunks and enough lightly salted water to cover to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until fork-tender, 14-18 minutes. \nWhile potato simmers, trim bottoms off Brussels sprouts and halve vertically (quarter if larger than a ping-pong ball). \nPat steaks dry, and season both sides with a pinch of salt and ¼ tsp. pepper. \n
162	30	1	Place a medium non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp. olive oil and Brussels sprouts, cut-side down, to hot pan.

Remove Brussels sprouts to a plate and cover with foil.\nWipe pan clean and reserve.\n
163	30	2	Once potato chunks are fork-tender, drain in a colander and return to pot. \nAdd half the milk, butter, Parmesan, ¼ tsp. salt, and a pinch of pepper.  Mash until smooth. \nIf necessary, add additional milk 2 Tbsp. at a time until desired consistency is reached.\nSet aside and keep warm.\n
164	30	3	Return pan used to cook Brussels sprouts to medium-high heat and add 2 tsp. olive oil. Add steaks to hot pan and cook until steaks reach a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees, 5-7 minutes per side. \nRemove steaks from pan and rest, 5 minutes.\nReserve pan; no need to wipe clean. \n
165	30	4	Return pan used to cook steaks to medium heat. Add sherry, demi-glace, and ¼ cup water and combine. Stir occasionally until slightly thickened, 2-3 minutes. \nPlate dish as pictured on front of card, placing steak on sauce. Bon appétit!\n
166	31	0	Thoroughly rinse produce and pat dry. Cut ends from yellow squash and zucchini. Use a peeler to cut long, flat ribbons from squash and zucchini. Stack ribbons and make thin, lengthwise cuts to form "noodles." (Perfection isn't important here - just make sure they're all roughly the same size.) Slice mushrooms into ¼" slices. Peel shallot, halve, and slice into very thin strips.\n
167	31	1	Line a plate with a paper towel. In a medium pan over medium heat, add 2 Tbsp. olive oil and sliced shallots. Bring oil to a very low simmer, stirring shallots often. Continue cooking about 7-8 minutes, or until shallots take on a deep brown color. Shallot slices may color at different rates, so remove slices as they are ready (deep brown but not black) to the towel-lined plate while others catch up. Once all shallots have been removed to plate, sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Drain all but 1 tsp. of delicious, shallot-infused oil and return pan to medium heat, reserving excess oil.\n
168	31	2	Add ground turkey to pan and break up into small pieces. Cook 5-6 minutes until browned and no pink remains and a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees has been reached. Remove turkey to a plate and return pan to heat without cleaning. The flavorful bits of food stuck to the pan, call the fond, will be released and incorporated into the mushroom sauce in the next step.\n
169	31	3	Add 2 tsp. reserved shallot-infused olive oil to the same pan over medium-high heat. Add sliced mushrooms and let brown 2 minutes. Add sherry and reduce 1 minute until mostly evaporated. Add chicken base, ½ cup water, and cream cheese to pan and stir until cream cheese is incorporated and chicken base has dissolved. Add grated Parmesan and cook about 3 more minutes, stirring often.\n
170	31	4	Add ground turkey, peas,  carrots, and vegetable "noodles" to pan. Stir gently to combine and cook 3 minutes until vegetables have softened. Taste, and if desired, season with a pinch of salt and pepper. (The chicken base and Parmesan may contain enough salt for your palate.)\n
171	31	5	Add a serving of turkey tetrazzini, including sauce, to a shallow bowl. Top with crispy shallots and serve.\n
223	41	1	Warm a grill pan or outdoor grill over medium-high heat. Lightly oil cut side of romaine with olive oil and place on the hot grill for one minute (a method called “flash-charring”).\n

Reduce heat to medium-high and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and add remaining butter and half the chives and swirl to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Finishing sauces by swirling butter into them is a technique called "mounting" the butter. This enriches and thickens by gradually emulsifying butter-y goodness into the sauce.\n
384	70	5	Arrange potatoes on a plate and drizzle with braising liquid. Spoon horseradish-chive sauce on plate. Place a steak on top of sauce and arrange Brussels and red pepper next to steak. Garnish with remaining chives and any remaining sauce.  The stout, barrel shape of fondant potatoes allows the flat sides to take on a deep sear. Braising them in chicken stock and butter makes them super savory and soft.\n

Stir to combine, mashing a bit with a spatula or spoon to release flavors. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Allow to sit at room temperature until ready to serve, or place in refrigerator to chill before serving.\n
388	71	3	Add 1 Tbsp. olive oil to the mixing bowl with the potatoes. Use potato masher or fork to mash the slightly cooled potatoes until they're almost the consistency of rice. Once mashed, add peas, remaining onion, remaining jalapeño, remaining cilantro (reserving a pinch for garnish), and chickpea flour. Using hands or a spatula, gently mix. Add the Aloo Tikki Spice Blend and a pinch of salt and pepper. Add a bit of olive oil to your hands and form mixture into 1½" balls. Gently flatten the balls between your palms to make 2½ x 1" thick patties.\n
389	71	4	Warm a medium pan with 1½ Tbsp. olive oil over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add 2-4 patties at a time to cook. Cook on each side for 5-7 minutes, or until patties become crisp, browned, and firm. Remove Aloo Tikki from pan and place on paper towel-lined plate to soak up any excess oil before serving.\n
390	71	5	Place 3-4 Aloo Tikki patties on a plate. Add a generous dollop of chutney next to the patties (or overtop, if you prefer to eat them that way). Garnish with remaining cilantro and any remaining lime wedges.\n

670	122	2	In a large bowl, combine lemon zest, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, Dijon mustard, 2 Tbsp. olive oil, and salt and pepper (to taste). Taste vinaigrette— if you prefer it to be more tart, add a bit more lemon juice. If you like it less tart, add a little more salt or olive oil. Set aside.\n
671	122	3	Use a spoon to collect pan drippings and baste, brush, or pour over browned side of chicken. Sprinkle or press tarragon on top of the basted side. Basting is a technique where the cooking juices, marinades, or other pan sauces are added back over the meat. This process helps to keep the meat super moist and flavorful, and gives the tarragon a layer to stick to.\n
672	122	4	In bowl with vinaigrette, add peas, apples, radishes, Parmesan cheese, arugula, spinach, and kale. Toss to coat evenly. Taste a leaf or two and add salt and pepper and any additional lemon juice to taste, if desired.\n

Add diced beets and cook 2 minutes, then add shallot and cook 30 seconds, or until aromatic. Add arborio rice and stir to coat with oil. Toast 1 minute.\n
749	136	2	Add 1 cup of hot vegetable broth to pot with rice. Rice should just be covered by broth. Stir rice continuously until nearly all broth is absorbed, then repeat with another cup of broth. Continue this process for 18-22 minutes, stirring all the while. Taste risotto as you cook to keep track of its tenderness. When rice has no more "bite" or crunch, it's done. You probably will not need all the broth, so check often. \n
750	136	3	While risotto cooks, heat 2 tsp. olive oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and cook until browned and softened, 5-6 minutes. Add asparagus and cook 2-3 minutes until asparagus is tender and slightly caramelized. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n

761	138	2	Heat 1 tsp. olive oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Remove pork from marinade and blot off excess marinade. (Reserve marinade to use as sauce in Step 5.) Add tenderloin to pan and sear until caramelized on all sides, about 6-8 minutes total. Place tenderloin on prepared baking sheet and cook 15 minutes or until a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees is reached. Let rest before slicing. Resting cooked meats allows the juices to redistribute, which means a juicier, more flavorful final product. Wipe pan clean for broccoli step. \n
762	138	3	In a medium pot, add 2 ½ cups water, sliced shiitake mushrooms, remaining soy sauce, remaining ginger, chicken base, and whites of green onion. Bring to a simmer and cook 15 minutes. Mix half of cornstarch with 1 Tbsp. cold water and combine remaining cornstarch with liquid eggs. Add water-cornstarch mixture to pot and stir. Reduce heat to barely a simmer. Hold a fork over pot and slowly pour liquid eggs in a stream through the tines. This technique helps achieve the egg "ribbons" that are traditional for this soup. Allow to simmer 1 more minute to set eggs, then remove from heat. Soup should be glossy and rich. \n
763	138	4	Bring pan from previous step with 3 Tbsp. water and a pinch of salt to a boil over high heat. Add broccoli florets and cover. Let broccoli steam for 2 minutes until bright green and fork-tender. Drain any excess liquid and move broccoli to a plate. In same pan, add reserved marinade and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook for two minutes and prepare to serve.\n

In a bowl, combine 1 tsp. olive oil, ricotta, lemon zest to taste, juice of half the lemon, half the chives, half the basil, half the peppercorns to taste, and a pinch of salt. Stir together until combined and smooth.\n
767	139	2	In a small pan, warm 1 tsp. of olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the shallot. Sauté until warmed and slightly caramelized, about 7-8 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and remove from heat.\n
768	139	3	In a clean mixing bowl, combine the shaved asparagus with 1 tsp. of olive oil and 1 tsp. of juice from the remaining lemon half and a pinch of salt. Using hands, gently massage the asparagus for about 30 seconds to remove bitterness before cooking.\n
769	139	4	Place pizza crusts on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly brush the crusts with a bit of olive oil (no more than 1 tsp. for both). Slather the ricotta mixture evenly on the pizzas. Add sautéed shallots. Add the asparagus ribbons, ensuring an even layer on the pizzas. Place in oven to bake for 10-12 minutes, or until vegetables are browned and tender, crust is crisp, and ricotta is slightly firm and darker in color.\n

787	142	4	Turn off heat. Slowly stir half of the sour cream into the soup (reserving remaining for garnish.) Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Gently stirring in sour cream off heat prevents it from separating or "breaking", and makes for a smooth and enriched sauce.\n
788	142	5	Place equal amounts of tomato soup into two soup bowls. Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and green onions. Cut grilled cheese sandwiches in half and stack three halves per serving next to soup. \n
789	143	0	Mince garlic. Trim zucchini ends and slice on an angle into &frac13" ovals. Stem, seed, and slice yellow bell pepper into wide 1 ½" strips.

1502	270	5	Divide salad between two plates and garnish with dried cherries and coriander almonds.\n
1503	271	0	On a cutting board, wash and thinly slice the heirloom tomatoes, and cut lemon in half. Thinly shave (this can be done with a potato peeler, lengthwise) the green onion and set aside. In a food processor, whir the cauliflower until you have about 3 cups that look like rice (do not overprocess or the crust will not set), and set aside.\n
1504	271	1	This step is crucial to ensuring your crust stays nicely bound. In a bowl, mix the 4½ tbsp of flax seed meal with 13½ tbsps of water, stirring in whisking motions with a fork as you go. Refrigerate your mixture for at least 15 minutes. Once refrigerated, the mixture will resemble the stickiness of egg whites and are ready to be incorporated in to your crust.\n
1505	271	2	Preheat the oven to 450F degrees and line two baking sheets with parchment or silpat liners and set aside. In a bowl, combine the minced cauliflower, set flax “eggs,” nutritional yeast, rosemary, garlic powder, almond powder, and 1 Tsp. of salt and pepper to taste. Mix together until a batter forms a sticky, slightly mushy dough. Portion the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, using about ¾ cup to 1 cup of dough per pizza. Use your hands to shape them into little pies, build up the crusts a bit, until they're about ½ inch-to-&frac23 inch thick (up to you, but allow a little more time to cook for thicker crust). Place the pizza crusts in the oven on the bottom rack – without toppings – and bake for 15-20 minutes at 450F. Remove from oven and add toppings.\n
1506	271	3	In the food processor, blend the fresh basil, almonds, garlic clove, the juice of one lemon, and salt and pepper to taste along with 2 tbsp olive oil (or water, if you’d like to lighten the recipe up a bit) and puree until your desired smoothness. \n
1507	271	4	Add and smother partially-baked crusts with a dollop of fresh pesto, and top with the thinly sliced heirloom tomatoes, shaved spring onions, and whatever toppings you may have kicking around the house. Do not use the arugula (that’s for garnish). Once topped, bake the pizzas on the top rack for 10-15 more minutes at 450F degrees. The crusts should be golden brown and irresistible-looking when done. Remove from heat and serve.\n
1508	271	5	These pizzas are more delicate, so you be the judge as to whether you should slice ‘em or serve them deep-dish style with a fork. Top with fresh arugula and extra shaved spring onion for a fresh taste. Enjoy!\n

1755	317	2	Add canned diced tomatoes, chickpeas, 1½ cups water, tomato paste, and vegetable base packets to pot. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes. Add zucchini and cook an additional 2 minutes. Season to taste with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n
1756	317	3	Carefully cut openings into tops of bread bowls and use your fingers to pull insides of the round loaf out. Leave enough inside so the walls are still thick enough to prevent leakage.\n
1757	317	4	Place bread bowls on prepared baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes, or until lightly toasted.\n
1758	317	5	Divide chili between bread bowls and garnish with remaining red onion, sour cream, and shredded Cheddar cheese.\n
1759	318	0	Bring a small pot with 1 ½ cups water and rice to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until tender and water has been absorbed, 17-20 minutes.\n
1760	318	1	Rinse frozen pineapple under warm water if still frozen. Cut pineapple into ½" dice. Mince garlic. Stem, seed, and cut green bell pepper into ½" dice. Core Roma tomato and cut into ½" dice. Trim and thinly slice green onions on an angle, keeping white and green portions separate. Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. On a separate cutting board, cut chicken into ½” dice. Season with ¼ tsp. salt and a pinch of pepper.\n
1761	318	2	Heat 2 tsp. olive oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken to hot pan and cook 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until chicken slightly browns. Remove chicken to a plate and wipe pan clean (chicken will finish cooking later). Return pan to medium heat. \n

1765	319	1	Bring 3 quarts of water to a rolling boil, add salt to taste. Add orzo to boiling water. Stir gently. Return to a boil. For authentic "al dente" pasta, boil uncovered, stirring occasionally for 7-8 minutes. For more tender pasta, boil an additional 1 minute. Remove from heat. Drain well and cover to keep warm.\n
1766	319	2	In three separate mixing bowls, place the flour, egg, and cheese and parsley mixture. Season the fish with a pinch of salt and pepper on each side. Dredge the fish through the flour, then the egg, then the parmesan cheese and chopped parsley mixture. Place the fish on plate and press firmly down on the fish and breading to make sure the breading is adhering to the fish. \n
1767	319	3	Heat a large sauté pan over medium heat and add 1 tsp of oil. When pan and oil are hot, gently place the fish in the pan. Cook on each side for 3-4 minutes or until the cheese is golden brown and the fish is firm to the touch. Watch closely; the cheese browns quickly if the flame is too hot.\n
1768	319	4	Heat a sauté pan over low heat. Add 1tsp oil to the pan along with the pesto. When pesto is warm add the orzo and cherry tomatoes. Mix the ingredients to incorporate and add salt and pepper to taste.  \n
1769	319	5	Place a scoop of orzo and cherry tomato mixture on the side of the plate. Lay the fish against the orzo. Garnish with remaining parsley. \n
1770	320	0	Lay peas on cutting board and halve lengthwise at an angle. Halve grape tomatoes. Rinse salmon, pat dry, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n

Stem, seed, and slice bell pepper into thin strips (julienne). Cut celery into ¼" pieces on an angle (bias). Trim and thinly slice green onions, keeping white and green portions separate. Coarsely chop peanuts. In a mixing bowl, prepare pork marinade by combining ginger, soy sauce, sugar, and half the green portion of green onions. Rinse pork chops, pat dry, and add to marinade.\n
1776	321	1	Spread Brussels sprouts on prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tsp. olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper and toss to combine. Roast in oven for 15-18 minutes or until lightly caramelized and tender.\n
1777	321	2	Heat 2 tsp. olive oil in medium pan over medium heat. Remove pork chops from marinade (reserve marinade for next step), shake off excess, and add to pan. Sear about 3 minutes per side, or until well-browned. Pork will finish cooking in a later step. Because of the marinade's sugar, pork chops will caramelize very quickly, so keep a close eye on them. Set seared pork on a plate and return pan to heat.\n
1778	321	3	Add 1 tsp. olive oil to pan in which pork was seared. Add celery, bell pepper, and white portion of green onion. Cook 4 minutes, stirring often, until slightly tender but not caramelized. Add pork chops back to pan, along with any accumulated juices and remaining marinade. Cook 3-4 more minutes until pork reaches a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees. Remove vegetables and pork to a plate. Wipe out pan and return to medium heat.\n
1779	321	4	Add kung pao sauce to pan and bring to a simmer. Add roasted Brussels sprouts and toss to coat with sauce. Cook 1 more minute until warmed throughout. Stir in peanuts and remove from heat.\n
1780	321	5	Place a serving of kung pao Brussels sprouts next to pork chops and stir-fried vegetables on a plate. Garnish with sesame seeds and remaining green onion.\n
1781	322	0	Preheat oven to 400 degrees and prepare a baking sheet with foil or use a nonstick baking sheet. Rinse pork tenderloin and pat dry. Thoroughly rinse produce and pat dry. Coarsely chop parsley. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the bouillon cube and ¾ cup warm water until fully dissolved. \n
1782	322	1	In a large plastic bag or bowl, combine the apple cider, whole cloves, and bay leaves to create a brine. Place pork tenderloin in the brine and allow to marinate for 1 hour. Once an hour has passed, remove tenderloin from the brine and pat it dry with a paper towel. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n
1783	322	2	In a medium pan over medium-high heat, warm 2 tsp. olive oil. Once warm, add the tenderloin and sear for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned. Transfer the tenderloin to the prepared baking sheet. Reserve any juices from pan for the gravy.\n
1784	322	3	Place tenderloin in oven to bake for 20-25 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches at least 165 degrees. Remove tenderloin from oven and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes to ensure juiciness. Once tenderloin has rested, slice into ½" thick slices. Reserve any pan drippings for the gravy.\n
1785	322	4	While tenderloin is cooking, use medium pan with the searing juices to prepare the pan gravy. Melt the butter over low heat. Whisk in the 2 Tbsp. flour and warm until the mixture begins to brown, stirring constantly. Whisk in bouillon liquid until incorporated. Remove from heat, add in heavy cream, peppercorns, pan and searing drippings, and salt to taste.\n

1789	323	2	Bake flatbreads in hot oven until cheese is melted and flatbreads are browned, 12-14 minutes.\nLet baked flatbreads cool, 5 minutes.\nWhile flatbreads cool, make salad. \n
1790	323	3	Place arugula in a mixing bowl with pepperoncini. Add any artichoke liquid, 1 tsp. olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss to combine.\n
1791	323	4	Plate dish as pictured on front of card, topping flatbreads with salad. Bon appétit!\n
1792	324	0	Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place a colander in the sink. Bring a medium pot with 2 cups of water to a boil - you'll only need 1 ½ cups, but some may boil off while you prep. Thoroughly rinse produce and pat dry. Mince garlic. Drain chickpeas. Cut roasted red peppers into ½" dice. Stem and coarsely chop cilantro. Cut broccoli florets into bite-sized pieces. Zest lemon. Mince lemon zest and halve lemon.\n
1793	324	1	Prepare a baking sheet with foil and cooking spray. Spread chickpeas on one half of the baking sheet and toss with 1 tsp. olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Bake for 15 minutes. Roasting the chickpeas will give them a toasty flavor and slightly crisp texture.\n
1794	324	2	In a medium mixing bowl, add couscous, ginger, garlic, curry powder, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Pour 1 ½ cups boiling water into bowl and stir about 10 seconds. Add 1 tsp. olive oil and mix well. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set aside for 10 minutes. Uncover and use a fork to fluff couscous. Couscous grains are actually small balls of pasta, and cook easily and quickly by just being covered with boiling water.\n
1795	324	3	Remove baking sheet from oven and stir chickpeas. Add broccoli to other half of baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tsp. olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss with tongs or two forks, being careful of hot baking sheet. Spread broccoli into single layer and return baking sheet to oven for 15 minutes, or until chickpeas are lightly browned and crispy and broccoli is lightly browned and tender. After removing baking sheet from oven, add roasted red peppers to the baking sheet and gently mix chickpeas, broccoli, and red peppers. Set aside.\n
1796	324	4	In a mixing bowl, combine yogurt, lemon zest, juice from half the lemon, half the cilantro, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Whisk until smooth and set aside. This creamy, citrus-y condiment provides a nice counterpoint to the highly spiced curry.\n
1797	324	5	Divide couscous between two plates. Add chickpea-vegetable mixture on top. Drizzle with lemony yogurt sauce and garnish with remaining cilantro, feta, and lemon wedge.\n
1798	325	0	Rinse quinoa in a wire-mesh strainer. Bring a small pot with rinsed quinoa, 2 ½ cups water, and ½ tsp. salt to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cover. Cook 18-20 minutes, or until water is absorbed and quinoa grains have "sprouted." Set aside. Rinse wire-mesh strainer clean.\n

1801	325	3	In bowl used for vinaigrette, combine yogurt, grated cucumber, lemon zest, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, and remaining oregano (reserve a pinch for garnish). Season with ¼ tsp. salt and a pinch of pepper.\n
1802	325	4	Place a serving of quinoa on a plate. Top with (or artfully arrange) Sweety Drop peppers (to taste), tomatoes, diced cucumber, olives, and crumbled feta. Top with yogurt sauce or serve on side. Garnish with reserved oregano.\n
1803	326	0	Preheat oven to 400 degrees and prepare a baking sheet with foil or use a nonstick baking sheet. Lightly coat a casserole dish or small cast iron skillet with cooking spray for cornbread. Thoroughly rinse produce and pat dry. Stem, core, and mince jalapeño. Mince garlic. Trim green beans. Rinse pork tenderloin and pat dry.\n
1804	326	1	In a mixing bowl, combine corn bread mix, jalapeño (to taste), egg, milk, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Pour batter into the prepared casserole dish and bake for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out dry and clean. Allow to rest for 5 minutes.\n
1805	326	2	Season pork with a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat an outdoor grill or grill pan over medium-high heat and lightly coat with cooking spray. Grill pork for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.  Transfer pork to baking sheet and roast for 10-12 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches a minimum of 145 degrees. Transfer to cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.\n
1806	326	3	Combine mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, garlic, mustard, 1 Tbsp. water, and ½ tsp. of black pepper in a mixing bowl. Refrigerate until plating. You'll find lots of regional BBQ styles scattered across the states, but one of the most unique is the use of white BBQ sauce in Alabama. Invented by Big Bob Gibson, this tangy condiment is great with chicken and pork.\n
1807	326	4	Heat a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp. olive oil, green beans, and ¼ cup water to the pan, cover and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until bright green. Uncover and cook another 1-2 minutes, or until tender. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside.\n
1808	326	5	Spoon some white BBQ sauce on the plate. Cut pork tenderloin into ½" thick slices and arrange over the sauce. Arrange a slice of cornbread and a serving of green beans on the plate. Serve additional sauce on the side.\n
1809	327	0	Halve potatoes, then cut each half into four wedges. Place wedges on prepared baking sheet and toss with 1 Tbsp. olive oil, ½ tsp. salt, and ¼ tsp. pepper. Spread into a single layer and roast until potatoes are tender and golden brown, 20-25 minutes. Potatoes will finish cooking in a later step. While potatoes roast, prepare ingredients.\n
1810	327	1	Stem parsley. Mince stems and finely chop leaves. Mince garlic. Halve tomatoes lengthwise. Pat steaks dry, and season both sides with ¼ tsp. salt and a pinch of pepper. \n

1812	327	3	Heat 1 tsp. olive oil in a medium non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes to hot pan, cut side down. Sear until browned, 2 minutes. Remove from pan. After potatoes have roasted 20-25 minutes, add tomatoes to baking sheet, seared side up. Bake until tomatoes are softened, but not mushy, 3-4 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside. Wipe pan clean and reserve.\n
1813	327	4	Return pan used to cook tomatoes to medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp. olive oil and steaks to hot pan. Sear undisturbed until browned, 3-4 minutes. Flip steaks, reduce heat to medium, and cook until steaks reach a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees, 4-6 minutes. Remove steaks from pan and rest 5 minutes.\n
1814	327	5	Serve potatoes on a plate and place tomatoes next to them. Slice steak into ¼" slices, if preferred. Serve steak up against potatoes and top with a spoonful of chimichurri. Serve remaining chimichurri on the side for dipping.\n
1815	328	0	In a medium bowl, add cashews and cover completely with water. (This is best done overnight, but as long as you soak them at least 30 minutes ahead of time, the results are still great.) Once softened, strain, reserve the water, and set aside.\n
1816	328	1	Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Prepare a baking sheet with foil or use a nonstick baking sheet. Thoroughly rinse produce and pat dry. Cut green onion into a dice. Finely slice jalapeño into thin rounds, removing seeds and membrane (the white innards of the jalapeño) if you prefer less heat. Drain and rinse black olives and black beans. (Do not drain pimentos.) Cut corn tortillas into eighths. \n
1817	328	2	In a blender or food processor, combine soaked cashews, 2 ½ cups water (including soaking water you reserved), juice of two lemons, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, pimentos (and liquid), nutritional yeast, and 3 tsp. salt to taste. Blend on high for about 2 minutes or until very smooth. Transfer to medium pot and warm on low-medium heat for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n
1818	328	3	Arrange tortillas on prepared baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes or until crispy. Ensure chips are not overlapping to ensure even cooking.\n
1819	328	4	Add two handfuls of chips on a plate. Smother with a ladle of warm nacho cheese sauce. Add black beans and salsa as desired. Garnish with jalapeños, black olives, and green onions.\n

1830	330	4	In a deep bowl, ladle a serving of cooked quinoa. Top quinoa with sautéed veggies (you can segregate veggies for a more vibrant and interesting look). Garnish with sliced radishes and drizzle with lemon tahini sauce. \n
1831	331	0	Set butter out to soften. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and prepare a baking sheet with foil or use a non-stick baking sheet. Thoroughly rinse produce and pat dry. Stem, seed, and dice red bell pepper into 1" pieces. Peel and halve shallot. Slice half the shallot into strips and finely dice the other half. Peel and cut carrot on an angle (bias) into ½" thick pieces. Scrub Yukon potatoes and cut into ½" rounds. Stem and mince parsley. Rinse steaks and pat dry.\n
1832	331	1	Place red pepper, carrots, and Yukon potatoes on baking sheet and toss with 2 tsp. olive oil, ½ tsp. salt, and a pinch of pepper. Roast about 15-20 minutes, then pull pan from the oven and add sliced shallots (reserve minced shallots for compound butter), stir lightly to coat with residual oil, and return to oven for another 10 minutes. \n
1833	331	2	Combine butter, honey, minced shallots (to taste - use about 1-2 tsp.), minced parsley, mustard, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl. Form into 2 discs about 1" wide and place on a plate in the fridge to harden. \n
1834	331	3	Warm 1 tsp. olive oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Season steaks with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook steaks 4-5 minutes per side, or until a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees is reached. Rest steaks for at least five minutes. Resting meat allows the juices to redistribute themselves, resulting in a juicier steak.\n
1835	331	4	Arrange roasted vegetables on a plate and place a steak next to the vegetables. Top steaks with a disc of mustard-herb butter. \n
1836	332	0	Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Slice the Brussels sprouts in half. Chop the peppers into 1 inch pieces. Slice the green onions into thin bias cut pieces. Rough chop the parsley.\n

1838	332	2	Place the bell peppers and Brussels sprouts into a large mixing bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and mix ingredients together. Place on a baking sheet and roast in the oven for 8-10 minutes or until the Brussels begin to brown and the all vegetables are fork tender.\n
1839	332	3	Heat a sauté pan over medium heat. Add 1 tbsp. of oil to the pan. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to the chicken breasts and then add to the pan. Cook on each side for 5-6 minutes or until golden brown (the chicken meat will be white throughout).\n
1840	332	4	Mix the roasted vegetables and quinoa together in the cooking pot. Add salt and pepper to taste and reheat the mixture on stovetop if needed.\n
1841	332	5	Take the salad mix from the bowl and place in the middle of the plate gently and try to build the salad up to give it some height. Top the salad with chopped green onions. Place the sliced chicken on the side of the plate.\n
1842	333	0	Heat 3 cups of water in a medium pot over high heat. Add vegetable base and stir to dissolve. Throughly rinse produce and pat dry. Trim ends from green beans and cut into 1" pieces. Quarter cremini mushrooms. Drain artichokes and roasted red peppers. Thinly slice roasted red peppers. \n
1843	333	1	Lower heat of boiling water to low and add saffron threads, pinching threads between thumb and forefinger to release as much of the flavor as possible. Keep broth warm while you begin paella.\n
1844	333	2	Heat a large pan over medium heat. (Pan ideally should be wide, shallow and heavy bottomed.)  Heat 2 tsp. of olive oil and add mushrooms and green beans. Season with paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir and cook until vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes.\n
1845	333	3	Add rice and tomatoes to pan. Stir to coat rice and cook until grains look slightly translucent, 2-3 minutes. Add saffron broth and stir once. (This is not risotto, so resist the urge to stir constantly!)\n
1846	333	4	After about 15 minutes, distribute peas, roasted pepper and artichoke hearts over the top of the paella. Again, don't stir! Continue simmering about 10 more minutes, or until all liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender.\n
1847	333	5	Paella is traditionally served family style, so you can place it directly at the dinner table (using a trivet or potholder to protect your table.) \n
1848	334	0	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and prepare 2 baking sheets with foil or use a nonstick baking sheets. Thoroughly rinse produce and pat dry. Peel onion and slice into thin strips. Slice zucchini and yellow squash into very thin rounds. Stem rosemary and mince leaves. Halve lemon and zest half for garnish. Rinse and drain the chickpeas. \n
1849	334	1	Arrange zucchini and squash on the prepared baking sheet, ensuring there is no overlap. Brush with little olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle ⅔ of the rosemary (reserving the rest for garnish) over the zucchini and squash, ensuring even coverage. Place in oven and bake for 8 minutes, then flip slices and bake for another 8 minutes. Remove from oven when zucchini and squash are caramelized. Reserve.\n
1850	334	2	In a food processor or blender, combine the drained chickpeas, garlic cloves, juice of lemon to taste, 1 Tbsp. olive oil (or water, if you prefer a lower fat hummus), and salt and pepper (freshly cracked is best) to taste. Blend until creamy and smooth. If desired, you can add 1 Tbsp. water to make consistency more viscous.\n
1851	334	3	Heat 2 tsp. olive oil and onion slices in a medium pan over medium heat. Spread the onions out evenly over the pan and let cook, stirring occasionally for 5-10 minutes, or until they start to brown. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n
1852	334	4	Add flatbreads to a baking sheet and place in oven to toast on each side for about 4 minutes. Remove from oven and assemble flatbread by spreading with hummus, followed by a few roasted zucchini and squash slices, and caramelized onions, and return to oven for another 5-7 minutes, or until slightly browned and flatbread becomes crisp. Remove from oven.\n
1853	334	5	Top warm flatbreads with baby arugula. With a pizza cutter, slice flatbreads into halves or fourths. Garnish with any remaining rosemary, a crack of fresh sea salt and black pepper, and any lemon zest to taste, if desired. These also make delicious and easy party appetizers!\n
1854	335	0	Thoroughly rinse and pat dry the produce. Drain black beans in a wire mesh strainer, rinse with water, and shake lightly to remove excess liquid.  Zest and halve lime. Peel and finely dice red onion. Mince garlic. Halve avocado, seed, skin, and cut flesh into ¾" dice. Stem and mince cilantro leaves. Stem, core, and finely dice jalapeño.

Add a pinch of salt, taste, and add more salt if desired. Set aside. \n
1856	335	2	Turn on your oven ventilation system or crack a window - Cajun seasoning can get a little smoky when it sears on a hot pan! Heat a medium non-stick pan over medium-high heat and add 1 tsp. of olive oil to the pan. Season both sides of the salmon with Cajun seasoning. Cook salmon on each side for 3-4 minutes, or until fish is opaque, flaky, slightly blackened, and reaches a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees.\n
